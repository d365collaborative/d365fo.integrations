# **Install as a Administrator**

This tutorial will show you how to install the d365fo.integrations on a machine where you have administrator access / privileges.

If you are **NOT** able to logon to the machine as an administrator, you should be using the [Install as a Non Administrator](https://github.com/d365collaborative/d365fo.integrations/wiki/Tutorial-First-Time-Install-Non-Administrator) tutorial instead.

## **Prerequisites**
* Machine with D365FO installed
* PowerShell 5.1
* Administrator privileges
* Internet access / Internet connection

## **Logon to the computer**
You need sign into the machine where you want to install the tools. Remember to sign in as an account with administrator privileges.

If you **don't** have an user account with administrator privileges, please follow the [Install as a Non Administrator](https://github.com/d365collaborative/d365fo.integrations/wiki/Tutorial-First-Time-Install-Non-Administrator) tutorial instead.

## **Start PowerShell (Run As Administrator)**
Locate the PowerShell icon, if you don't have it on your desktop or in the task pane, we can locate it in the Windows Start Menu. Search for it or type PowerShell.

You need to right click on the PowerShell icon and select the "Run As Administrator" option for the menu.

You need to either accept or approve all the prompts, for things to work like expected. See below examples on the which prompts you can expect and what response you should fill in.
