OData has a concept **EntitySetName** which is the name of the entity set exposed by the OData service. The entity set name is usually the plural form of the entity name. In this case, the entity set name is `SystemUsers`. In most situations, OData will want you to use the entity set name instead of the entity name. \n",

Instead, use the `-EntityName`, `-EntityNameContains`, or `-ODataQuery` parameters to retrieve the entities you are interested in. For the purpose of this notebook, we will use the `-EntityName` parameter to retrieve the metadata for the `SystemUser` entity.\n",

    "# Deleting users\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last part of this scenario notebook, we will look at deleting a record in an entity. This is done with the `Remove-D365ODataEntity` cmdlet. Like all previous cmdlets, it requires the `-EntityName` parameter, which we will set to `SystemUsers`. Like the `Update-D365ODataEntity` cmdlet, it requires the key of the entity to be provided. We already know the key of the `SystemUser` entity, which is the `UserID` field. We will use the same user id as before to delete the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is already all you ned to know. Look at the next cell to see how the user is deleted."

    "Congratulations on making it through this notebook. You have learned how to retrieve, create, update, and delete users in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. You have also learned about OData entities, their metadata, and how to interact with them using d365fo.integrations. This is a great foundation for further exploration of the capabilities of d365fo.integrations and Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations."
